1.1.84
Official MCT Discord https://discord.gg/ujY2mV9
Hopefully fixes issue #183

1.8.81
Fixed reflectors not recalculating their states after being loaded
Fixed issue where the gas turbine requires ignition whenever it gets loaded
Gas Turbine can now correctly accept power provided by IE's connectors, 
 - also made them slightly cheaper to run, down to 3072FE per tick, to account for power attenuation on the wires
(Check configs on the gas turbine power change, value will need to be reset)

If you input Distilled Water in the Cooling tower it returns Distilled Water from "Exhaust Steam"
New Multiblock code being integrated eventually to all multiblocks (currently only used on the cooling tower)

Added CraftTweaker function for adding always-pressurized fluids to Pipes (Steam is enabled by default)
 - Only if replace_IE_pipes in config is true
Hijacked IE pump, can now change its transfer rate when fluid is pressurized
 - Uses pipe_pressurized_transfer_rate in config file to determine its transfer rate into IT pipes
Performance boost for IT implementation of pipes
 - Only if replace_pipe_algorithm in config is true

1.7.55
*** Major Balancing Changes***
Boiler Biodiesel consumption is now 10Mb instead of 5Mb (Silfryi)
Boiler Gasoline consumption is now 50Mb instead of 5Mb (Silfryi)
Boiler Diesel consumption is now 7Mb instead of 5Mb (Silfryi)
This puts them more in line with IE and IP power production values

**Steam now produces more per mB of water then less**
1000Mb Water Produces 2000Mb Steam
1000Mb Distilled Water Produces 3000Mb Steam
Steam Turbine now consumes 500Mb of steam per operation and returns 50Mb water by default
**To accommodate this you will need pumps to extract Steam from the Boiler and Solar Tower at Pressurized Rates in pipes (1000Mb)**

An optimal setup for one Steam Turbine would be -
3 Distillers outputting Distilled water to -
1 Solar Tower with 4 Solar Reflectors and

1 Boiler
Then feed a Steam Turbine with -
1 Pump extracting Steam from the Solar Tower and
1 Pump extracting Steam from the Boiler

Also Optimized tanks on various TEs
A fix for #98 Boiler Fuel Consumption was half what it should be
A fix for #97 Fluid stack could be Null in some cases

1.7.54
Implement #90, multiblock structures now show in JEI
Fix #91 Fluids not updating properly in the Advanced Coke Oven

1.7.53

	- caution on known paths, multiple tanks with the same fluid will have loops. Use valves to alleviate loops

Added manual entries for Barrels
Prevent Open Barrel from underfilling
Last feature release for 1.12, bugfixes are the only thing planned from now on

1.7.52
