BIG WARNINGS
#1 BREAK ALL SOLAR TOWERS, SOLAR MIRRORS, AND ADVANCED COKE OVENS BEFORE UPDATING
#2 The steam turbine cycle has CHANGED. Your turbines will NO LONGER return water in the usual way.
#3 Combustion machines NO LONGER WORK IN VACUUM
#4 Some other heat processing machines NO LONGER WORK IN VACUUM OR HAVE REDUCED EFFICIENCY
#5 Delete configs so they will regenerate

Added in high pressure steam & high pressure steam turbine - they produce 24576 IF/t and are disabled by default, there only if people want to enable them and tweak them for stuff like NC compat    (Silfryi)
High pressure steam turbine takes either tungsten if it exists or nickel for anything tungsten that does not exist    (Silfryi)
High pressure steam turbine turns high pressure steam into normal steam for a cycle that requires two turbines    (Silfryi)
Steam turbine steam output is now below shaft block    (Silfryi)
Changed steam cycle to now require heat exchanging exhaust steam for hot water (Hot spring water from BOP if it exists) and running that through a cooling tower - Pumping water for this will be _hard_ to get that much water    (Silfryi)
LARGE amounts of Advanced Rocketry compat
    - Combustion now needs a oxygenated atmosphere to run in. No more boilers on the moon    (Silfryi)
    - Heat transfer now varies based on atmosphere heat conduction vs radiative heat radiation    (Silfryi)
    - Anything solar-related now varies based on AR insolation (sun brightness) values    (Silfryi)
Temperatures are now normalized to sane values, not 12000 'temperature units', they're now normalized to ~600C, about the top of a standard turbine cycle today    (Silfryi)
Advanced Coke Oven has been removed, but the bricks stay to allow packs to use them for other things. BREAK MULTIBLOCK BEFORE UPDATING    (Silfryi)
Solar tower has been completely redone
    - Now an actual solar concentrator tower design    (Silfryi)
    - Mirrors AND tower will need to be disassembled before updating or things WILL crash!    (Silfryi)
    - Molten sodium cycle can now be used for energy storage    (Silfryi)
Added Melter, Solar Melter, and Electrolytic Crucible Battery for use in sodium production from salt    (Silfryi)

*** Major Balancing Changes***
Boiler Biodiesel consumption is now 10Mb instead of 5Mb (Silfryi)
Boiler Gasoline consumption is now 50Mb instead of 5Mb (Silfryi)
Boiler Diesel consumption is now 7Mb instead of 5Mb (Silfryi)
This puts them more in line with IE and IP power production values

**Steam now produces more per mB of water then less**
1000Mb Water Produces 2000Mb Steam
1000Mb Distilled Water Produces 3000Mb Steam
Steam Turbine now consumes 500Mb of steam per operation and returns 50Mb water by default
**To accommodate this you will need pumps to extract Steam from the Boiler and Solar Tower at Pressurized Rates in pipes (1000Mb)**

An optimal setup for one Steam Turbine would be -
3 Distillers outputting Distilled water to -
1 Solar Tower with 4 Solar Reflectors and

1 Boiler
Then feed a Steam Turbine with -
1 Pump extracting Steam from the Solar Tower and
1 Pump extracting Steam from the Boiler

A fix for #98 Boiler Fuel Consumption was half what it should be
A fix for #97 Fluid stack could be Null in some cases
